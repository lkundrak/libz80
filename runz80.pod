runz80 - Run program for the Z80 processor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over 4

=item B<runz80> [B<--raw>|B<--cpm>] [<I<program.bin>>]

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<runz80> is a very rudimentary Z80 system emulator. It serves as an
example and testbed for I<libz80>. Its capabilities are limited to loading
raw or CP/M com programs, serial I/O, terminating itself and leaving an
execution trace log.

UART is emulated to provide basic serial I/O.

Emulation stops upon encountering a I<halt> instruction or error.

Verbose output is controlled with I<DEBUG_Z80> and I<DEBUG_IO>
environment variables.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--raw>

Treat the image as a raw program. Load the program at 0xf000, with a copy
at 0x0000 (for Altos IOP compatibility). No ROM call emulation is attempted.

=item B<--cpm>

Treat the image as a CP/M program. Map minimal BIOS at 0x0000 and load the
program at 0x0100.

The minimal BIOS implements system calls 2 and 9. It's just enough to be
able to run YAZE test programs.

=back

Without any option, the program type is guessed. Files ending with I<.com>
are assumed to be CP/M program while everything else is treated as raw.

=head1 MEMORY MAP

=over

=item 0x0000

COM programs terminate by jumping here. There's a HALT instruction here.

Raw programs are copied here too, for Altos 586 IOP compatibility.
The IOP has a 8K ROM mapped at this address.

=item 0x0005

COM programs have a BDOS system call handler for console I/O here.

=item 0x0100

COM programs are loaded here.

=item 0xf000

Raw programs are loaded here (and also copied to 0x0000).

Good for I<Z80SerialMonitor> built with I<CONSTANTS-F000-E0.asm> configuration.

=back

=head1 I/O MAP

=over

=item 0x20 -- 0x24

CTC timer. Present at this address on Altos 586 IOP, all I/O ignored.


=item 0x2c -- 0x2d

SIO serial port. Present at this address on Altos 586 IOP.


=item 0xe0 -- 0xe3

DART serial port.

Good for I<Z80SerialMonitor> built with I<CONSTANTS-F000-E0.asm> configuration.

=back


=head1 BUGS

Some instructions are probably wrong.

Interrupts are not implemented.

No R800 or 8080 support.

It is slow and ugly, just like you.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over

=item I<DEBUG_Z80>

Causes execution trace to be sent to stderr when set to any value.

=item I<DEBUG_IO>

Causes I/O trace to be writen to stderr when set to any value.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over

=item C<< runz80 Z80SerialMonitor/Z80Monitor.bin >>

Run the serial monitor.

=item C<< DEBUG_Z80=1 runz80 yaze/test/prelim.com 2>exec.log >>

Run the quick test suite, preserve the execution trace.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over

=item L<https://github.com/electrickery/Z80SerialMonitor>

A lovely Z80 serial monitor that works with this emulator.

=item L<https://github.com/begoon/yaze>

Another Z80 emulator. Faster, nicer, actually correct. Contains a test suite
that can be run with this emulator.
