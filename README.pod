=head1 libz80 -- A Z80 disassembler and emulator

This is a Z80 disassembler, emulator that can also be used as a library.

Note that while it works fairly well and provides a (hopefully) reasonable
library interface, it's not the best one out there. Read on to see if it's
good for you.

=head2 Emulation Accuracy

While the emulator accurately emulates documented instructions, the
emulation of some undocumented behavior is not 100% accurate.

This is okay if you're running a program generated by one of the standard
assembers out there, a program that's intended to be portable across
different silicon versions and so on. Reasonable programs should be okay.
Run a test suite (see below) to get an idea of what works.

On the other hand, if you're running a demoscene program, or writing an
emulator that's intended to reproduce historic experience, you should
probably be looking elsewhere.

=head2 Testing

Run C<make smoke> to run the basic checks.

Of the I<z80test> suite the two tests of undocumented behavior affecting
I<IY> and I<IX> are expected to fail as is the test that expects (for
reasons not understood) the load from I<R> register to be zero. I believe
it to be a test suite error, because I've never made a mistake.

=head2 Documentation

The C<disz80> and C<runz80> programs have manuals.
Run C<make disz80.pdf runz80.pdf> to format them for printing.

The library API is not well documented. It's simple -- consult F<z80.h> and
source of afforementioned programs for how it's used.
